# Intelligent-ChatBot


The main aim of this project is to develop an intelligent chat bot for institutions. Later
this code can be converted into any applications. This chatbot works in both offline and
online mode. The chatbots will become more matured while having more data training.
This application works in various types of browsers as well in various networks.
This Intelligent Chat Bot has an admin. Admin has all the rights to access this application,
also data training. Data training is the most important part of this project. All the trained
data will be reflected in this application for chatbots queries. This trained data will be
used for automatic (ie) offline mode only. This chatbot can be used by many users at the
same time. The IP address plays the main role in this application
Here uses can post their corresponding queries. The chatbot will provide relevant
information to the user. The major classifications in this application are Offline mode and
online mode.

1. Online Mode: A real person will be available on another side to the user
queries. No automation required. The user can ask even untrained data.
the user will get a prompt reply. This process is like a normal chat
application. The main disadvantage of this process is a real should be
available always.
2. Offline Mode: This is a totally automated process. This is the real chatbot.
This process required data sets and trained data. The user questions will
be answered automatically. No need for a real person to be present
always.

Intelligent Chat Bot projects are frequently used in situations in which simple interactions
with only a limited range of responses are needed. This can include customer service and
marketing applications, where the chatbots can provide answers to questions on topics
such as products, services or company policies. If a customerâ€™s questions exceed the
abilities of the chatbots, that customer is usually escalated to a human operator.
